This is so dissapointing. Probably one of the biggest hopes and let downs for a good looking, well designed, platform. I've uploaded at least three good lists, this last pull took a lot of time to clean up. I had to develop a query and a system and clean the file. Still nothing. Enrichment report seems very proud of itself with 1 enrichmente. Who? Can't tell. Don't know.

This is so dissapointing. Probably one of the biggest hopes and let downs for a good looking, well designed, platform. I've uploaded at least three good lists, this last pull took a lot of time to clean up. I had to develop a query and a system and clean the file. Still nothing. Enrichment report seems very proud of itself with 1 enrichmente. Who? Can't tell. Don't know.

This is so dissapointing. Probably one of the biggest hopes and let downs for a good looking, well designed, platform. I've uploaded at least three good lists, this last pull took a lot of time to clean up. I had to develop a query and a system and clean the file. Still nothing.

This is so dissapointing. Probably one of the biggest hopes and let downs for a good looking, well designed, platform. I've uploaded at least three good lists, this last pull took a lot of time to clean up. I had to develop a query and a system and clean the file. Still nothing. Enrichment report seems very proud of itself with 1 enrichmente. Who? Can't tell. Don't know.

This is so dissapointing. Probably one of the biggest hopes and let downs for a good looking, well designed, platform. I've uploaded at least three good lists, this last pull took a lot of time to clean up. I had to develop a query and a system and clean the file. Still nothing. Enrichment report seems very proud of itself with 1 enrichmente. Who? Can't tell. Don't know.

This is so dissapointing. Probably one of the biggest hopes and let downs for a good looking, well designed, platform. I've uploaded at least three good lists, this last pull took a lot of time to clean up. I had to develop a query and a system and clean the file. Still nothing. Enrichment report seems very proud of itself with 1 enrichmente. Who? Can't tell. Don't know.

Hi Nick, I hope you're having a great day. We are currently working with Nicholas Merendina's profile and would like to inquire if the organization could provide at least a phone number or an address. Additionally, could you kindly confirm if the LinkedIn profile we have is the correct one? Thank you for your assistance.
