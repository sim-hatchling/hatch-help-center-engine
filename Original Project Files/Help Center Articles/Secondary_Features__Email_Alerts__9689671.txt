## **Managing Notifications for Gift Officers**

When adding gift officers as users to provide self-service access, they may not want to receive all Hatch email notifications (birthdays, news alerts, elevated profiles).

Currently, there is no built-in toggle to customize notifications by user. 

The recommended solution is to set up email filters:

  * **For Outlook users:** Create a rule to automatically move emails from support@hatch.ai to a specific folder. You can also include any email containing "Hatch" in the subject line.

  * **For Gmail users:** Create a filter that automatically labels or archives emails from Hatch notification addresses.

  * 


**Best Practice:** Prospect researchers should receive all notifications to stay informed about donor activities, while gift officers can filter notifications but still maintain account access for profile lookups during meetings or travel.

## Email Alert Managment

Unfortunately, there is no ability to manage which emails are sent to you. The only way to stop receiving emails is to be removed as a user on the account.
