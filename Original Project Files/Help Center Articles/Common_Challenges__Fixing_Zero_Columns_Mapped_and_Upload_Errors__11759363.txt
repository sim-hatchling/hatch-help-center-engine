 _Customer feedback: "Zero columns are mapped" and "It appears my file is not uploading"_

## Quick Fix for Most Upload Issues

**The #1 cause of upload failures:** Row 1 contains data instead of column headers.

**Immediate Solution:**

  1. Open your CSV file in Excel or Google Sheets

  2. Check if Row 1 contains actual data (names, emails, etc.)

  3. If yes, **right-click on row number "1" and delete the entire row**

  4. Save the file and try uploading again




**This fixes 80% of "zero columns mapped" errors instantly.**

**Required for ANY enrichment:**

  * ‚úÖ First Name (required)

  * ‚úÖ Last Name (required)

  * ‚úÖ **PLUS at least one of:** Email address, Phone number, or Complete home address




‚ö†Ô∏è **Without these, the upload will show "not qualified" status.**

## Understanding Upload Process and Column Mapping

When you upload a CSV, Hatch uses AI to automatically match your columns to our fields:

**Step 1: File Upload**

  * Select your CSV file (Excel files work too)

  * Click "Next" to begin mapping




**Step 2: Column Mapping** _(Review This Carefully)_

  * **Left side:** Your file's column names

  * **Right side:** Hatch fields they're mapped to

  * **Fill percentage:** Shows how much data is in each column

  * **Sample data:** Preview of actual values




**Step 3: Review Import**

  * See exactly what will be imported

  * Check enrichment status for each contact

  * Understand why some contacts might not enrich




**What to Expect After Upload:**

  * ‚è±Ô∏è **Processing time:** 5-30 minutes depending on list size

  * üìß **Email notification:** You'll receive confirmation when complete

  * **Status options:** Optimal enrichment (best results), Partial enrichment, No enrichment, or Not qualified

# Common Problems and Solutions

## Problem: "Zero Columns Are Mapped"

**Most likely cause:** File format issues or improper headers

**Solutions:**

  1. **Check Row 1:** Must contain only column headers (First Name, Email, etc.)

  2. **Remove empty columns:** Delete columns with no data

  3. **Fix duplicate headers:** Ensure each column has a unique name

  4. **Save as CSV:** Convert Excel files to CSV format before uploading




## Problem: "File Is Not Uploading" or Stuck

**Most likely cause:** File size, browser issues, or connection problems

**Solutions:**

  1. **Refresh the page** and try again

  2. **Use a different browser** (Chrome works best)

  3. **Check file size:** Large files (10,000+ contacts) may take longer

  4. **Split large files:** Try uploading in smaller batches




## Problem: "Column Mapping Looks Wrong"

**Most likely cause:** Similar column names confusing the AI mapper

**Solutions:**

  1. **Manually correct mappings** using the dropdown menus

  2. **Rename columns** in your CSV to be more specific:

     * "Email" instead of "E-mail" or "Email Address"

     * "First Name" instead of "First" or "FName"

     * "Last Name" instead of "Last" or "LName"




## Problem: "Should I Cancel and Try to Upload Again?"

**When to cancel:**

  * Zero columns mapped after trying the fixes above

  * File has been "processing" for over 45 minutes

  * Error messages appear during upload




**When to wait:**

  * File is actively uploading (progress bar moving)

  * Large file (5,000+ contacts) recently submitted

  * Mapping looks correct but processing hasn't started




* * *

## File Preparation Best Practices

**Before You Upload:**

  1. **First row = headers only** (no data in row 1)

  2. **Required columns present:** First Name, Last Name, plus Email/Phone/Address

  3. **Clean data:** Remove empty rows and duplicate headers

  4. **Save as CSV:** Use "Save As" ‚Üí "CSV (Comma delimited)"




**Expert Tips:**

  * **Keep it simple:** First Name, Last Name, Email works great

  * **One header row:** Row 1 should only contain column names

  * **Avoid special characters:** Stick to letters, numbers, spaces in headers

  * **Test with small batch:** Try 50-100 contacts first




**Good news:** You don't need to rename fields or put them in a specific order! Hatch's AI mapping handles different column names and orders automatically.
