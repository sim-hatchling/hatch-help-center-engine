## **Start with Test Uploads**

Before importing your full database, test with 500-1000 records to:

  * Verify column mapping accuracy

  * Review enrichment results quality

  * Establish workflow with your team

  * Identify any data formatting issues




## **Donor Selection Criteria**

When choosing which donors to include in Hatch:

**Recommended criteria:**

  * Last gift date within 5-10 years (recency indicates continued engagement)

  * Email engagement (opens, clicks) even if no recent gifts

  * Event attendance (shows ongoing interest despite lack of donations)




**Why these criteria matter:** Donors who haven't given in over 10 years are significantly less likely to respond to solicitation. However, those showing other engagement signals may simply need the right ask at the right time.

## **Upload Size Strategy**

  * Test batch: 5% of enrichment quota

  * Initial working set: 20% of enrichment quota

  * Full database: After workflow is established




Remember: Your enrichment limit is lifetime for your contract period, so strategic selection maximizes value.
