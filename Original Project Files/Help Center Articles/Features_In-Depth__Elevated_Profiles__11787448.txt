## Explanation

Elevated Profiles are confirmed and completed by a Hatch prospect researcher. Every profile datapoint is confirmed manually and any missing data that is available on the web is added.

* * *

## Request

Request any Hatch profile to be Elevated by selecting the **Elevated Profile** button at the top of every donor profile. A form will open on the left with optional questions. The more information you provide, the better results you will see upon Elevation completion. Once you've answered all questions possible, scroll to the form's bottom and select "Send".

* * *

## Turnaround Time

Elevated Profiles are expected to be turned around in 2 business from the day they are requested. In cases where the prospect researcher is challenged to complete the Elevation, you will be notified. See "Issue & Delays" below.

* * *

## Email Notifications

Once Elevated Profiles are complete, an email notification is sent to all users on the account. The email includes key details about the Hatch person, including a link directly to the Hatch profile.

## AI Scoring & Insights

All Elevated Profiles contain updated AI Scoring & Insights. Further edits made to the profile will rerun Scoring with the same 10 minute mechanism described in the "AI Scoring & Insights" article.

* * *

## EP Filters

Filter for "Elevated" or "Elevating" profiles on both the All Profiles page or any list. Elevated Profiles filters are in the bottom filter section "Prospect Management".

* * *

## Usage

Elevated Profiles only count against your monthly quota once they are complete. Any requested EPs that exceed your available quota will be fulfilled in the next quota period. Your monthly quotas reset to 0 on the day of the month your subscription began.

* * *

## Issues & Delays

Researching people is a nuanced task. Where complexities arise, a ticket will be opened in Intercom (our in-app chat), notifying you of the possible delay. We may ask you for additional information on the person. We do our best to set expectations around when the profile will be sent out.
