## Quick Fix for Missing Exports

**Most common issue:** Export emails go to spam or get blocked by corporate security.

**Immediate Solution:**

  1. **Check your spam/junk folder** for emails from `exports@hatch.ai`

  2. **Add Hatch to your approved senders** (instructions below)

  3. **Contact your IT department** if emails are still blocked




**This resolves 90% of export delivery issues within minutes.**

**What to Expect:**

  * **Small exports (under 1,000 contacts):** 5-10 minutes

  * **Large exports (1,000-10,000 contacts):** 15-30 minutes

  * **Very large exports (10,000+ contacts):** 30-60 minutes




⚠️ **If you don't receive your export within 30 minutes, check spam then contact support.**

## Understanding Email Delivery and Security Issues

## Adding Hatch to Approved Senders

**Gmail Users:**

  1. **Find the Hatch email** in spam/junk

  2. **Click "Not spam"** button

  3. **Mark as important** (star icon)

  4. **Add contact:** Click on `exports@hatch.ai` → "Add to contacts"




**Outlook Users:**

  1. **Right-click on Hatch email** in junk folder

  2. **Select "Mark as Not Junk"**

  3. **Go to Settings** → "Block or Allow"

  4. **Add sender:** Enter `exports@hatch.ai` and `*.hatch.ai`

  5. **Save settings**




**Enterprise Email Systems:** Provide this information to your IT department:

  * **Domains to whitelist:** `exports@hatch.ai`, `support@hatch.ai`, `*.hatch.ai`

  * **Business justification:** "Nonprofit prospect research platform for donor database management - SOC 2 certified, GDPR compliant"




## Corporate Security Blocks

**"My security will not let me continue to the website"**

**What's happening:** Corporate firewalls often block new domains by default.

**Immediate workarounds:**

  1. **Use the backup download link** provided in export emails

  2. **Download file first, then open** (don't open directly from browser)

  3. **Try from personal device/network** as temporary solution

  4. **Request IT whitelist** for `*.hatch.ai` domains

## Common Problems and Solutions

## Problem: Export Emails Going to Spam

**Solutions:**

  1. **Check spam/junk folders** thoroughly

  2. **Add`exports@hatch.ai` to contacts** preemptively

  3. **Create email filter/rule** specifically for `@hatch.ai` emails

  4. **Add entire domain** (`*.hatch.ai`) not just specific addresses




## Problem: Corporate IT Blocking Access

**Information for Your IT Department:**

  * **Company:** Hatch (Giving Intelligence Platform)

  * **Business purpose:** Nonprofit donor prospect research and database enrichment

  * **Security:** SOC 2 Type II certified, enterprise-grade encryption

  * **Compliance:** GDPR compliant, nonprofit-focused data privacy standards

  * **Technical:** Standard HTTPS (443), no special firewall rules needed




## Problem: "Clicked Other Option to Save Link and It Didn't Work"

**Alternative approaches:**

  1. **Right-click link → "Save target as"** (downloads file directly)

  2. **Copy link address → paste in new tab** (bypasses some restrictions)

  3. **Use different browser** (Chrome tends to work best)

  4. **Disable browser extensions temporarily** (ad blockers can interfere)




## Problem: Export Emails Still Missing After 30+ Minutes

**Check these locations:**

  1. **IT quarantine systems** (ask IT to check)

  2. **Email address accuracy** in your Hatch account settings

  3. **Corporate email delays** (some systems have 15-30 minute delays)

  4. **Alternative email address** for exports (temporary solution)

## File Handling and Alternative Access Methods

## Working with Downloaded Files

**Best practices:**

  1. **Save to local computer first** (don't open directly from email)

  2. **Scan with antivirus** if required by your organization

  3. **Open in Excel or Google Sheets** for best viewing

  4. **Keep export emails** for re-downloading if needed (links active for 30 days)




## Backup Download Options

**When direct links are blocked:**

  1. **Use the secondary download link** in export emails

  2. **Copy link and paste in new browser tab** (bypasses some blocks)

  3. **Download on mobile device** using cellular data

  4. **Use personal email address** for exports (temporary solution)




## VPN and Network Workarounds

**Corporate VPN issues:**

  * **Disconnect VPN temporarily** while downloading (if permitted)

  * **Try different VPN servers** if your organization allows switching

  * **Use guest network** at your office if available




**Important:** Always follow your organization's IT policies.

**Common Format Notes:**

  * **Multiple emails in one cell:** Normal - primary email used for enrichment, additional emails separated by commas

  * **Phone numbers formatted as text:** Preserves formatting and prevents Excel from removing leading zeros




* * *

## Proactive Setup Best Practices

**Before your first export:**

  * **Add`exports@hatch.ai` to contacts** preemptively

  * **Coordinate with IT during onboarding**

  * **Test with small export first**

  * **Set up alternative email** if corporate restrictions are strict




**For IT Administrators:**

  * **Add`*.hatch.ai` as trusted domain**

  * **Include in firewall exceptions** for file downloads

  * **Add to email security platform** approved senders

  * **Consider user training** on recognizing legitimate Hatch emails




**Conversation starter for IT:**

"We need to whitelist *.hatch.ai for our nonprofit's donor research platform. It's SOC 2 certified and used for prospect database enrichment. Can you add these domains to our approved list?"
