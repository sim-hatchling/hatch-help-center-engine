# Map Your Columns

  1. Help Hatch understand your data by identifying the data point for each column that you're importing. Use the examples underneath the "Uploaded columns (your data)" column names to ensure the columns are properly mapped to Hatch fields.

  2. Review the automated Hatch field mapping to ensure the fields are correctly mapped.

  3. The "Field importance" is the importance of the Hatch field you mapped to, and the "Fill percentage" is that of the Uploaded column from your data.

# Await Approval Email

Bulk uploads are typically approved within 12 hours. If a bulk upload is submitted toward the end of the day, it may only be approved in the morning. In contrast, uploads submitted in the morning or early afternoon may be approved quickly. Once an upload is approved, you will receive an email letting you know the upload has been queued for enrichment. Currently, all bulk enrichments can be expected to complete 24 hours from receipt of the approval notice. The extended processing time is due to the bulk enrichment queue. Soon there will be a precise time of enrichment completion, so you can know when to check back for your results.
