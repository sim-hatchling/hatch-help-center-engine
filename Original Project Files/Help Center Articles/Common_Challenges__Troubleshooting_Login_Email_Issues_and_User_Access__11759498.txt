## Understanding User Management and Email Delivery

## Step-by-Step User Addition

**From your admin account:**

  1. **Go to Settings** → "Team" or "Users"

  2. **Click "Add User"** or "Invite Team Member"

  3. **Enter exact email address** (double-check spelling)

  4. **Select appropriate permissions** (Admin, User, Viewer)

  5. **Send invitation** and notify the user to check email




**Important:** Use the person's primary work email address for best delivery.

## Permission Levels Explained

**Admin Access:** Full platform access and settings, can add/remove team members, access to billing and account management, can request Elevated Profiles

**Standard User:** Full prospect research capabilities, can upload and enrich databases, access to all enriched profile data, cannot manage other users

**Viewer Access:** Read-only access to enriched profiles, can search and view existing data, cannot upload new data or request elevations, cannot access admin settings

## Corporate Email Delivery Issues

**Microsoft Exchange/Outlook environments:**

  * External invitations often blocked by default

  * IT must whitelist `*.hatch.ai` domain

  * Safe sender lists need updating




**Google Workspace organizations:**

  * Check admin console for external sharing restrictions

  * May require IT to approve "less secure app" access

  * Domain-wide delegation sometimes needed




**Other enterprise email systems:**

  * Firewall rules may block authentication emails

  * Security policies often restrict external login links

## Common Problems and Solutions

## Problem: Login Emails Not Arriving

**Systematic troubleshooting:**

  1. **Email delivery check:** Look in primary inbox, spam/junk folder, promotions tab (Gmail)

  2. **Corporate email delays:** Wait 15-30 minutes for security scanning

  3. **Email address verification:** Double-check spelling, confirm address is active

  4. **IT quarantine systems:** Ask IT to check email quarantine/security holds




## Problem: "Could It Be Blocked by Your Email Client?"

**Information to provide your IT team:**

  * **Email domains to whitelist:** `noreply@hatch.ai`, `invitations@hatch.ai`, `support@hatch.ai`, `*.hatch.ai`

  * **Technical specifications:** Authentication emails contain secure login links, links expire after 7 days, HTTPS required, SOC 2 compliant authentication system




## Problem: User Sees Wrong Organization Data

**Account conflict resolution:**

  * User may have multiple Hatch accounts

  * Email address associated with different organization

  * Contact support to merge or reassign accounts




## Problem: Login Links Redirect to Error Pages

**Browser and device solutions:**

  * **Clear browser cache** and cookies

  * **Try incognito/private browsing** mode

  * **Use different browser** (Chrome recommended)

  * **Disable browser extensions** temporarily

  * **Check popup blockers** (may prevent login flow)

## Alternative Access Methods and Troubleshooting

## Temporary Access Solutions

**When login emails consistently fail:**

  1. **Use existing admin account temporarily**

  2. **Share screen** for training/demonstration purposes

  3. **Export needed data** for user to work with

  4. **Continue troubleshooting** email delivery in parallel




**Security note:** Change shared password after resolving email issues.

## Alternative Email Addresses

**If corporate email is blocked:**

  1. **Try personal Gmail/Yahoo** for initial setup

  2. **Change email** to work address after successful login

  3. **Add both emails** to approved senders during transition




**Process:**

  * Send invitation to personal email

  * Complete account setup

  * Change email address in profile settings

  * Add work email as secondary contact




## Removing and Re-Adding Users

**When to remove/re-add:**

  * Email address changes (if email update isn't working)

  * Persistent authentication errors after 48+ hours

  * User reports seeing wrong organization data




**Proper removal process:**

  1. **Remove user** from team settings

  2. **Wait 15 minutes** for system processing

  3. **Re-add with same or different email**

  4. **Notify user** to check email immediately

  5. **Have user check spam** within first 10 minutes




**Important:** User's data access history is preserved during removal/re-addition.
