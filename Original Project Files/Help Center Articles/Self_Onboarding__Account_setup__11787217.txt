## Add your EIN and Mission

Head over to your My organization settings and add your EIN. After that, write a mission statement including your programs, audience served, political orientation (if applicable), size, and geographic scope. The tone should be factual and neutral. Keep the entire text under 1000 characters.

**Mission Statement Guidelines:** Your mission statement directly powers the Donations Affinity Score and Profile Affinity Score through AI analysis. To ensure accurate scoring:

  * Maintain any geographic emphasis that Hatch generates - location details help AI match prospects with regional giving patterns

  * Preserve budget or organizational size information - this helps calibrate wealth and giving capacity assessments

  * Include specific program areas and beneficiary populations - this enables accurate mission alignment scoring

  * Avoid removing structural elements - edit for accuracy rather than completely rewriting sections




The mission statement serves as the comparison baseline when AI evaluates how well a prospect's giving history and personal interests align with your organization's work.
