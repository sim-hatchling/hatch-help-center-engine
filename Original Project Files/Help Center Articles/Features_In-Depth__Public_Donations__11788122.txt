Public donations are external donation records that Hatch automatically enriches to individual profiles. Because public donations directly most AI Scores, it's crucial to verify their accuracy and manage their status properly.

**Why This Matters:** Incorrect public donation matches can skew a donor's scores, leading to inaccurate Target Ask Amounts and misguided outreach strategies.

## Understanding Donation Confirmation Status

Public donations are color-coded based on their confirmation status:

#### Red Donations (Unconfirmed)

  * Automatically generated by the system

  * Require human review and verification

  * May include incorrect matches




#### Yellow Donations (Semi-Confirmed)

  * Automatically generated by the system

  * Have some verification but still need human review

  * More reliable than red but not fully confirmed




#### Green Donations (Confirmed)

  * **Require human confirmation** \- no donations are automatically marked green

  * Fully verified as belonging to the correct person

  * Most reliable for scoring calculations




**Viewing Status:** On All Profiles, you'll see summed public donations grouped by confirmation color. Hover over any color to see the count of donations in that status.

## Managing Donation Accuracy

#### Hiding Incorrect Donations

When public donations are incorrectly matched to a profile (wrong person with similar name), use the hidden status:

  1. Select the red or yellow icon next to the incorrect donation

  2. Choose "hidden status"

  3. **Important:** Hidden donations have no impact on any scoring calculations




#### Bulk Editing Donations

To efficiently manage multiple donations, you can bulk edit by selecting:

  * All donors with the same name

  * All recipient organizations with the same name

  * For political donations: all donations with the same location or all donors with the same job title




This is particularly useful for correcting systematic matching issues or confirming multiple donations from the same source.

## Impact on Scoring Systems

Public donations affect multiple scoring calculations:

#### Propensity Score

  * Includes both public and your organization's donation data

  * Directly affected by public donation confirmation statuses

  * More confirmed (green) donations = more reliable propensity calculations




#### Donations Affinity Score

  * Measures giving affinity based on historical donations

  * Uses both public and your organization's donations

  * Each recipient organization contributes to the score based on mission alignment with your organization




#### RFM Score

  * **Special Case:** When your organization's data shows no donations for a given year, but public records show donations to an organization with your same EIN, Hatch automatically includes those public donations in the RFM calculation

  * Helps provide more complete giving history




#### Affluence Score

  * Factors include: home value, properties owned, stocks, inferred salary, and more

  * Public donation patterns contribute to overall affluence assessment

  * Scores of 93 and above indicate billionaire-level wealth




**Important:** When ANY donation on a profile is marked as green (confirmed), all red and yellow donations on that same profile are automatically discounted from scoring calculations. This is because the system assumes that once manual confirmation has occurred, the confirmed donations represent the most accurate giving data. This design choice ensures that manually verified information takes precedence over unconfirmed public records.

## Foundation Affiliations

When you notice a foundation grant-giving affiliation is missing from a donor profile:

  * Contact support through in-app chat

  * Provide the link to the OpenGiving foundation profile

  * The foundation will be added to the donor profile to complete AI Scoring accuracy

## Best Practices

  1. **Regular Review:** Periodically review donation colors, especially for high-value prospects

  2. **Prioritize Green Status:** Focus on confirming important donations to green status for most accurate scoring

  3. **Hide Aggressively:** When in doubt about incorrect matches, use hidden status to prevent scoring distortion

  4. **Use Elevated Profiles:** For your most important prospects, request Elevated Profiles where Hatch researchers manually verify all donation data
