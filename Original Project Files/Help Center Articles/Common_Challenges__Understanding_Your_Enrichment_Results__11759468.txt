## Quick Fix for Finding Your Enriched Data

**Most common confusion:** "I can see enrichment happened, but I can't find the enriched profiles."

**Where to find your results:**

  1. **Go to your main dashboard** after enrichment completes

  2. **Look for the "Prospects" or "Database" section**

  3. **Enriched profiles appear with green/yellow indicators**

  4. **Click individual profiles** to see the Complete Human Profile data




**Your enriched data doesn't replace your original data - it enhances it with 70+ additional data points.**

**Understanding the "1 Enrichment" Message:**

  * 1 contact received optimal enrichment

  * Other contacts may have partial enrichment

  * Some contacts didn't enrich due to data limitations

  * **This is normal for many uploads**

## Understanding Match Quality and Enrichment Categories

## The Color-Coded System

**Green bars = Strong match confidence**

  * Matched using email + phone or address

  * Highest data accuracy

  * Most comprehensive enrichment




**Yellow bars = Moderate match confidence**

  * Matched using name + city/state

  * Good data accuracy

  * Some enrichment available




**No bars/Empty = No official match**

  * Only basic data populated

  * Lower confidence in accuracy

  * Limited enrichment data




**This system tells you immediately which profiles have the most reliable data.**

## Enrichment Categories Explained

**Optimal Enrichment ‚úÖ**

  * **What it means:** Strong match with multiple identifiers

  * **Data included:** Complete Human Profile with 70+ data points, wealth indicators, social media presence, career history, public giving history

  * **How it happened:** Contact had email + phone + address, or email + full name + location match




**Partial Enrichment ‚ö†Ô∏è**

  * **What it means:** Likely match with limited identifiers

  * **Data included:** Basic demographic data, some wealth indicators, limited social presence

  * **How it happened:** Contact had name + location, or email only, or phone only




**No Enrichment ‚ùå**

  * **What it means:** Couldn't confidently match this person

  * **Data included:** Only the original data you provided

  * **Why it happened:** Insufficient identifying information, very common name, or person not in our data sources




**Not Qualified üö´**

  * **What it means:** Missing required basic information

  * **Issue:** Missing first name, last name, or both

  * **Solution:** Add missing name fields and re-upload




* * *

## Common Problems and Solutions

## Problem: "Can't Tell Who Got Enriched"

**Solution:** Look for the colored bars next to profile names in your dashboard:

  * **Green bars = enriched profiles**

  * **Click individual profiles** to see enrichment data

  * **Use filter options** to view only enriched contacts




## Problem: "Anyone with a Middle Initial Isn't Showing Last Names"

**Known display issue** being addressed by our development team. **Workaround:** Full name data is still captured and searchable, display formatting will be corrected in upcoming update.

## Problem: "Enrichment Seems Incomplete"

**Check the match confidence level:**

  * **Green bars = most complete data available**

  * **Yellow bars = partial data based on available information**

  * **No bars = minimal enrichment possible with provided data** **This reflects data availability, not system errors.**




## Problem: Low Enrichment Rates

**Common reasons for limited results:**

  * **Very common names** without additional identifiers ("John Smith" with only a city)

  * **Outdated contact information** (old emails, changed phone numbers)

  * **Privacy-focused individuals** (limited online presence, minimal public records)

  * **International contacts** outside our data coverage (strongest coverage is US-based)

## Maximizing Your Enrichment Results

  * Provide complete addresses with ZIP+4 when available




**Additional identifiers:**

  * Spouse names help with matching

**Provide as much identifying info as possible:**

  * Full legal names (not nicknames)

  * Current email addresses
