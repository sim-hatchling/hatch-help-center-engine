# Parent-Child Account Management for Partners

This guide covers account management for consultant partnerships using Hatch's parent-child account structure.

## Account Structure Overview

### Parent Account (Consultant/Agency)

- Master account with oversight of all client sub-accounts
- Can view, search, and manage data across all child accounts
- Manages credit allocation and user permissions
- Creates and manages client sub-accounts

### Child Accounts (Nonprofit Clients)

- Individual accounts for each nonprofit client
- Data isolation - cannot access other child accounts
- Independent user management (4 seats per child account minimum)
- Full platform functionality within their account scope

## Creating and Managing Sub-Accounts

### Account Setup

1. Navigate to Organizations page from parent account
2. Click "Add Sub-account"
3. Enter client organization details and alias (for identification)
4. Allocate enrichment credits and QuickSearch quotas
5. Configure user permissions and upload settings
6. Send invitation to client organization contact

### Account Identification

- Sub-accounts display with custom aliases in parent account view
- Blue banner indicates when browsing a child account
- Account switching uses email indicators (parent vs child account emails)

## Data Management Across Accounts

### Duplicate Donors

- Same person can exist in multiple child accounts
- Data stored separately per account - no cross-contamination
- Use User ID for accurate duplicate detection within accounts
- Parent account search shows results across all child accounts with account identifiers

## Tags and Status Management

### What Works

- Create/edit tags and status from parent account for any donor
- Parent-created tags/status appear in child accounts automatically
- Child account filtering by parent-created tags/status works correctly
- Status filtering from parent account works correctly

### Current Limitations

- Tags created at parent level don't work in parent account filters
- Workaround: Use child account view for tag filtering or use Status fields for parent-level filtering

### Data Uploads and Enrichment

- Child accounts can upload independently (if enabled)
- Upload permissions controlled by parent account
- Enrichment credits shared from parent account allocation
- Separate donation upload process available

## Best Practices for Partners

### Client Onboarding Strategy

1. Start with 1-3 pilot clients in Month 1
2. Test workflows and refine processes
3. Scale to 5+ clients by Month 3
4. Document successful use cases for new client onboarding

### Account Management

- Use Status fields for parent-level prospect management and filtering
- Leverage account aliases for clear client identification
- Monitor credit usage across child accounts
- Regular check-ins with child account users for support needs

### Data Quality

- Encourage User ID inclusion in uploads for accurate duplicate detection
- Establish tagging conventions across client accounts
- Use status fields for high-priority prospects
- Regular data refresh for key prospects

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Payment Processing Delays

- Parent account functionality available during payment processing
- Limited enrichment quotas until payment confirmation
- All features accessible except full credit allocation

### User Access Issues

- Use email+alias method for child account access if needed
- Verify user permissions from parent account settings
- Check account status and subscription activation

### Filtering and Search

- Status filtering recommended for parent-level management
